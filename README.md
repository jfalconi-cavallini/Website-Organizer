To use this to autoamte your work environment. 

Simply replace list with list of website links you need to open for a given situation. 

I have 4 lists for different work environments needed. 

Create this file in your home directory and run python open.py <# of list you want to do>

If wanted you can opt to use a name instead of a number, a number was just easier for me to type out quicker.
